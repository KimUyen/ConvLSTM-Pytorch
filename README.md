## Goal
The ConvLSTM model is mainly used as skeleton to design a BCI (Brain Computer Interface) decoder for our project (Decode the kinematic signal from neural signal).
This repo is implementation of ConvLSTM in Pytorch. The implemenation is inherited from the paper: Convolutional LSTM Network-A Machine LearningApproach for Precipitation Nowcasting

BCI decoder is a part in BCI system, which is clearly shown in the above figure.

## Example of using ConvLSTM
convlstm_decoder.py contains an example of defining a ConvLSTM decoder.

Here is an example of defining 1 layer bidirectional ConvLSTM:
```
        convlstm_layer = []
        img_size_list=[(10, 10)]
        num_layers = 1              # number of layer
        input_channel = 96          # the number of electrodes in Utah array
        hidden_channels = [256]     # the output channels for each layer
        kernel_size = [(7, 7)]      # the kernel size of cnn for each layer
        stride = [(1, 1)]           # the stride size of cnn for each layer
        padding = [(0, 0)]          # padding size of cnn for each layer
        for i in range(num_layers):
            layer = convlstm.ConvLSTM(img_size=img_size_list[i],
                                        input_dim=input_channel, 
                                         hidden_dim=hidden_channels[i],
                                         kernel_size=kernel_size[i],
                                         stride=stride[i],
                                         padding=padding[i],
                                         cnn_dropout=0.2, 
                                         rnn_dropout=0.,
                                         batch_first=True, 
                                         bias=True, 
                                         peephole=False, 
                                         layer_norm=False,
                                         return_sequence=True,
                                         bidirectional=True)
            convlstm_layer.append(layer)  
            input_channel = hidden_channels[i]
```

## Explaination
The imlementation firstly was inherited from  [the repo](https://github.com/ndrplz/ConvLSTM_pytorch).

However, I changed the source to have more exactly to the original paper [1].
### 1. ConvLSTM definition
Which are following in the paper definition:
<p align="center">
    <img src="/figures/ConvLSTM_definition.png">
</p>

The ConvLSTM Cell is defined as following figure:
![](/figures/ConvLSTM_cell.png)

### 2. Bidirectional ConvLSTM decoder
Our BCI decoder is a 5 timesteps bidirectional ConvLSTM, which contains two ConvLSTM layer: a forward layer to learn direction from left to right input, a backward layer to learn direction from right to left input. Detail in following figure:
![](/figures/BCI_decoder.png)

### 3. Input, output for decoder
The input of our decoder is spike count or LMP, and output is velocity.

## Environment
This repository is tested on Python 3.7.0, Pytorch 1.6.0
